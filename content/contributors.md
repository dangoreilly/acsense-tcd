This will be the user management page.

It will be used to add, edit and delete users. You will also be able to manage user roles and permissions. Granular access can be granted to sections or buildings, or a combination of both. _(e.g. a user can be granted access to a specific section in a specific building, or a specific section in all buildings, or all sections in a specific building, or all sections in all buildings, etc.)_

Permissions for editing things like branding, settings, etc. will be managed here too. Only Admin users will be able to access this page.

When the internal map editor is built, this page will also be used to manage access to the map editor. Only users with the correct permissions will be able to access the map editor.

When gaeilge is implemented, you will be able to set if a contributor has access to the english or irish version of the site, or both.
