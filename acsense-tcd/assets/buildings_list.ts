A podium plaza between Berkeley and James Ussher libraries contains a mature tree and a glass pyramid which provides light to the concourse beneath. The atrium that divides the book stacks and the readers' areas provide good views of College Park and give visual respite through access to trees and natural light. Generally quiet, busier around exam times, with many desks on the top floor reserved for postgraduate students. Sound can echo loudly in the stairwell, and the elevator can be both slow and very busy.",

The west of the building is filled with more buzzing, electrical sounds due to machinery. The foyer and walkways are filled with echoed sounds throughout the building.",
