This page will allow for changing different map settings, such as the zoom level that labels show up. 

There will be a facility for uploading "overlays" for different zoom levels, such that graphic designers can add high detail maps of outdoor spaces built using external programs instead of everythin being built with the acsense tools.

This will also be the management page for the "landing screen" text.

In Summary

* Control when labels show up
* Set welcome message
* Upload images to main map screen
* Default landing location
