Navigation nodes nodes currently include stairs and lifts. They allow for idiomatic navigation between floors, as well as
aiding in the planned automatic generation of navigation paths. They also help users to manually plan their own navigation.

Select the node type, and which floors the node is present on. Lifts only have one map point, but stairs have an up and down point.
Move all points around by dragging them on the map. Hovering over a point will show the node's name.

The map does not update dynamically when you change the node data, so you need to manually refresh to see your changes take effect.
